# Workout Log

### Project:
I set out to create a workout log that enabled me to input my workout data and analyze weekly progress to ensure that I am achieving progressive overload, a key principle in strength training, in specific exercise movements. 

The workout log takes inputs such as muscle group, exercise name, sets, reps, and weight, and calculates the total training volume (sets × reps × weight) for each exercise. The data is organized into a structured dataset where users can monitor weekly volume for each exercise, helping them track progression over time. Weekly volume is automatically calculated for each exercise and displayed alongside other workout statistics. Additionally, the workout log generates bar charts to display weekly volume progression, allowing users to see their performance trends over time.
